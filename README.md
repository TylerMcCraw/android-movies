#android-movies
This is the companion project for the Udacity Android Nanodegree program [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree), in which students are instructed to build a simple movie discovery Android application.

## Usage

android-movies allows users to view a list of movies.
This data is pulled from TheMovieDatabase, an open-source API for retrieving movie data.

If you would, as a developer, like to use your own TheMovieDatabase API Key, please go to https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api to generate your own API key and fill this into the constant TMDB_APIKEY in the .java class
